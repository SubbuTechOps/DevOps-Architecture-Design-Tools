- Consider direction (TB, LR, etc.)

### 5.3 CloudCraft Recommendations
- Start with AWS import
- Use layers for different environments
- Document assumptions
- Regular synchronization with live environment

## 6. Conclusion

The choice of architecture design tools should align with your team's needs, technical requirements, and organizational constraints. A combination of tools often provides the most comprehensive solution, allowing for both high-level visual representations and detailed technical specifications.
